# Introduction

The **Job Portal App** is a modern web-based application that connects **students** who are actively seeking jobs or internships with **recruiters** offering employment opportunities.  
It aims to make recruitment more organized, faster, and transparent for both sides.

## Problem Statement

The traditional recruitment process often involves lengthy communication, multiple applications, and unclear status tracking.  
Students face difficulty knowing whether they are selected or rejected, and recruiters find it challenging to manage a large number of applicants manually.  

This project solves these issues by providing a **centralized platform** where:
- Students can easily browse and apply for jobs.
- Recruiters can efficiently manage job postings and applications.
- Both parties can communicate through a single, structured system.

## How It Simplifies the Process

The Job Portal App simplifies the entire hiring workflow by offering:
- **Centralized job listings:** All available jobs are displayed in one place.
- **Role-based access:** Recruiters and students have separate dashboards and permissions.
- **Application tracking:** Students can see their job application status (Pending, Under Review, Interview Scheduled, Hired or Rejected) in real-time.
- **Data security:** Authentication ensures that user data and applications remain secure.

This system makes job management convenient and provides a professional, digital experience for both recruiters and applicants.
